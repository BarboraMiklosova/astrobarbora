# AGN Feedback (Master's project)

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic phenomena in the
Universe. In my master's project I focus on how feedback from AGN can
affect the gas content of galaxies and regulate their star formation.

This page will collect short notes, figures, and links related to the
project as it develops — from data and methods to preliminary results.
