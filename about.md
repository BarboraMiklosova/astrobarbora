# About this site

<!--author-->

This site is a small hub for my work and interests as a master’s student
in astrophysics. It is meant to be lightweight, easy to maintain, and
focused on clear writing rather than flashy design.

You’ll mainly find:

- A short overview of who I am on the front page  
- A more structured summary of my background on the [CV](/cv/) page  
- Occasional posts and notes in the [Posts](/posts/) section  

## What I like working on

I enjoy problems where physics, data, and programming meet. In practice
that means:

- Turning raw survey data into clean, interpretable results  
- Writing small, reusable analysis tools in Python  
- Creating visualizations that make complex ideas feel intuitive  

## About the technology

This site is built with Jekyll and the Hydejack theme, which generate
static HTML pages. That makes it fast, portable, and easy to host on
services like GitHub Pages or Netlify.

If you are curious about how everything is put together, the full source
code of this site lives in the same repository that powers the page
you are reading now.
