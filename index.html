<h2 id="introduction">Let me introduce myself</h2>

<p>
  Born and raised in a small town in Slovakia, I've been studying astrophysics at Masaryk University. Having obtained
  my Bachelor's degree in June 2025, I've decided to pursue Master's studies with expectation to continue in the academic path. I am based in Brno, but love 
  undertake the 10-hour train ride back home ever so often. 
</p>

<p>
  I have a passion for astrophysics outreach and helping younger students succeed in their academic stuggles.

  For a detailed overview of my education, research experience, skills,
  and talks, please see my dedicated

<p>
  Every so often, I create a small piece of digital art or write down my thoughts. Sometimes, it will be possible to
  find it in the  
  <a href="{{ "/posts/" | relative_url }}">Posts</a> section.
</p>


<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

<p>
  If you’d like to talk about astrophysics, my research or my favourite coffee, feel free to reach out by an email (see the sidebar) or
  via any of the social links there.
