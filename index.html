<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
  I am a master’s student in astrophysics with a soft spot for galaxies,
  large surveys, and the stories that data can tell about the Universe.
  I enjoy working at the intersection of physics, programming, and
  visualization — using code to test ideas and communicate results clearly.
</p>

<p>
  Here you’ll find a short overview of who I am, what I work on,
  and how to reach me.
</p>

<h2 id="personal-info">Personal info</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Name:</strong> Barbora Miklošová</li>
  <li><strong>Field:</strong> Astrophysics (M.Sc.)</li>
  <li><strong>Interests:</strong> galaxies, cosmology, data analysis, scientific Python</li>
  <li><strong>Based in:</strong> Brno, Czech Republic</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you are curious about my background and experience, you can find
  a more structured overview in my <a href="/cv/">CV</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="cv">CV</h2>

<p>
  For a detailed overview of my education, research experience, skills,
  and talks, please see my dedicated <a href="/cv/">CV page</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="research-projects">Research and projects</h2>

<p>
  I’m interested in research questions that connect observation and theory,
  for example how galaxy properties depend on environment, or how to extract
  robust information from imperfect data. I enjoy:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building reproducible analysis pipelines in Python</li>
  <li>Exploring and visualizing large data sets</li>
  <li>Writing concise, clear explanations of scientific results</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Over time, I’ll use the <a href="/posts/">Posts</a> section to share notes, small
  projects, and explanations that might be useful for other students
  and curious readers.
</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

<p>
  If you’d like to talk about astrophysics, data analysis, or potential
  collaborations, feel free to reach out by email (see the sidebar) or
  via any of the social links there.
</p>

<p>
  I’m always happy to hear from other students and researchers — or from
  anyone who just enjoys looking up at the night sky.
