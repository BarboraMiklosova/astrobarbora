<h2 id="introduction">Let me introduce myself</h2>

<p>
  Born and raised in a small town in Slovakia, I've been studying astrophysics at Masaryk University. Having obtained
  my Bachelor's degree in June 2025, I've decided to pursue Master's studies with expectation to continue in the academic path. I am based in Brno, but love 
  undertake the 10-hour train ride back home ever so often. 
</p>

<p>
  I have a passion for astrophysics outreach and helping younger students succeed in their academic stuggles.
</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

<p>
  If you’d like to talk about astrophysics, data analysis, or potential
  collaborations, feel free to reach out by email (see the sidebar) or
  via any of the social links there.
</p>

<p>
  I’m always happy to hear from other students and researchers — or from
  anyone who just enjoys looking up at the night sky.
