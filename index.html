## Introduction

I am a master’s student in astrophysics with a soft spot for galaxies,
large surveys, and the stories that data can tell about the Universe.
I enjoy working at the intersection of physics, programming, and
visualization — using code to test ideas and communicate results clearly.

Here you’ll find a short overview of who I am, what I work on,
and how to reach me.

## Personal info
{: #personal-info}

- **Name:** Barbora Miklošová  
- **Field:** Astrophysics (M.Sc.)  
- **Interests:** galaxies, cosmology, data analysis, scientific Python  
- **Based in:** Brno, Czech Republic  

If you are curious about my background and experience, you can find
a more structured overview in my [CV](/cv/).

## CV

For a detailed overview of my education, research experience, skills,
and talks, please see my dedicated [CV page](/cv/).

## Research and projects

I’m interested in research questions that connect observation and theory,
for example how galaxy properties depend on environment, or how to extract
robust information from imperfect data. I enjoy:

- Building reproducible analysis pipelines in Python  
- Exploring and visualizing large data sets  
- Writing concise, clear explanations of scientific results  

Over time, I’ll use the [Posts](/posts/) section to share notes, small
projects, and explanations that might be useful for other students
and curious readers.

## Contact
{: #contact}

If you’d like to talk about astrophysics, data analysis, or potential
collaborations, feel free to reach out by email (see the sidebar) or
via any of the social links there.

I’m always happy to hear from other students and researchers — or from
anyone who just enjoys looking up at the night sky.
