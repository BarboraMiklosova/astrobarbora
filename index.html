<h2 id="introduction">Let me introduce myself</h2>

<p>
  Born and raised in a small town in Slovakia, I've been studying astrophysics at Masaryk University. Having obtained
  my Bachelor's degree in June 2025, I've decided to pursue Master's studies with expectation to continue in the academic path. I am based in Brno, but love 
  undertake the 10-hour train ride back home ever so often. 
</p>

<p>
  I have a passion for astrophysics outreach and helping younger students succeed in their academic stuggles.
</p>

<p>
  For a detailed overview of my education, research experience, skills,
  and talks, please see my dedicated
  <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV page</a>.

<h2 id="research-projects">Research and projects</h2>

<p>
  I’m interested in research questions that connect observation and theory,
  for example how galaxy properties depend on environment, or how to extract
  robust information from imperfect data. I enjoy:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building reproducible analysis pipelines in Python</li>
  <li>Exploring and visualizing large data sets</li>
  <li>Writing concise, clear explanations of scientific results</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Over time, I’ll use the <a href="/posts/">Posts</a> section to share notes, small
  projects, and explanations that might be useful for other students
  and curious readers.
</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

<p>
  If you’d like to talk about astrophysics, data analysis, or potential
  collaborations, feel free to reach out by email (see the sidebar) or
  via any of the social links there.
</p>

<p>
  I’m always happy to hear from other students and researchers — or from
  anyone who just enjoys looking up at the night sky.

<h2>About this site</h2>

<p>
  This site is a small hub for my work and interests as a master’s student
  in astrophysics. It is meant to be lightweight, easy to maintain, and
  focused on clear writing rather than flashy design.
</p>

<p>
  You’ll mainly find:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A short overview of who I am on the front page</li>
  <li>A more structured summary of my background on the
    <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a> page</li>
  <li>Occasional posts and notes in the
    <a href="{{ "/posts/" | relative_url }}">Posts</a> section</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I like working on</h3>

<p>
  I enjoy problems where physics, data, and programming meet. In practice
  that means:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turning raw survey data into clean, interpretable results</li>
  <li>Writing small, reusable analysis tools in Python</li>
  <li>Creating visualizations that make complex ideas feel intuitive</li>
</ul>

<h3>About the technology</h3>

<p>
  This site is built with Jekyll and the Hydejack theme, which generate
  static HTML pages. That makes it fast, portable, and easy to host on
  services like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
</p>

<p>
  If you are curious about how everything is put together, the full source
  code of this site lives in the same repository that powers the page
  you are reading now.
