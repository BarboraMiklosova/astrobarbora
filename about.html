<h1>About this site</h1>

<!--author-->

<p>
  This site is a small hub for my work and interests as a master’s student
  in astrophysics. It is meant to be lightweight, easy to maintain, and
  focused on clear writing rather than flashy design.
</p>

<p>
  You’ll mainly find:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A short overview of who I am on the front page</li>
  <li>A more structured summary of my background on the <a href="/cv/">CV</a> page</li>
  <li>Occasional posts and notes in the <a href="/posts/">Posts</a> section</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I like working on</h2>

<p>
  I enjoy problems where physics, data, and programming meet. In practice
  that means:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turning raw survey data into clean, interpretable results</li>
  <li>Writing small, reusable analysis tools in Python</li>
  <li>Creating visualizations that make complex ideas feel intuitive</li>
</ul>

<h2>About the technology</h2>

<p>
  This site is built with Jekyll and the Hydejack theme, which generate
  static HTML pages. That makes it fast, portable, and easy to host on
  services like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
</p>

<p>
  If you are curious about how everything is put together, the full source
  code of this site lives in the same repository that powers the page
  you are reading now.
