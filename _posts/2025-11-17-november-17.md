Yes, I wasn’t alive back then, I don’t know what it was like or how “good” people supposedly had it. But I do know what the freedom won on November 17th, 1989 brings me.

Freedom, for me, is that I can study whatever I want, even beyond the borders of Slovakia, regardless of whether my parents were “in the Party” or whether I am religious. Regardless of which philosopher I admire or how I express my opinions in a lecture. I’m not confronted with outdated information covered up by propaganda or censorship. Research is no longer driven by hatred toward “the other side of the world,” but by a shared goal — a better society that wants to understand what it is.

Freedom, for me, is that even after leaving the country, I can come home anytime, stay in constant contact with those who stayed, without putting their careers or safety at risk in any way.

Freedom, for me, is that I can sit in a café with friends, drinking coffee from any corner of the world without having to get it under the counter. That I can freely express my views without fear that someone will report me. That we can plan a road trip without having to bribe border guards or look for holes in barbed wire. That we can play Pink Floyd or Queen in the car without fear that we could be expelled from university the next day because of what we listen to or who we spend time with.

Freedom, for me, is also that I can travel to countries other than the “permitted” ones. I can experience different cultures not just through propaganda or a phone screen, but firsthand. I can authentically find out what life is like elsewhere, without someone mindlessly insisting that a certain country is wise and beautiful.

Freedom, for me, is that I can read whatever I want, that I have access to books that critically evaluate the state of society. And freedom is that I can then form my own opinion. And that I don’t have to hide it — I can share it freely and openly.

At the end of the day, freedom is that I can write this and put it out there without secret police knocking on my door in the morning. And that I can write in chalk on the sidewalk that truth still prevails.

Freedom is that even though our chalk messages may be washed away by the November rain, the words of the powerful are written in the heart of a society that does not forget.

**Thank you that I can** 🤎 #17remember
