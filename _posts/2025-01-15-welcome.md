description: A short note about this site and what you can expect to find here.

This is a small space where I collect things that don’t quite fit into a formal CV or research page:

- Short reflections on studying astrophysics  
- Occasional figures or notes from ongoing projects  
- Small creative pieces or visualizations I enjoy making  

I’ll add more posts here over time as ideas and energy allow.
