My current research focuses on how energy from active galactic nuclei (AGN)  
and large-scale shock structures in the cosmic web shape the evolution of  
galaxies and their surrounding gas. On this page you can find a short overview
of my work on [AGN feedback](#agn-feedback) and [shocks in the cosmic web](#shocks).

## AGN feedback

Active galactic nuclei are among the most energetic phenomena in the Universe.
In my bachelor’s thesis, *Probing the radio-mechanical AGN feedback using
multi-cavity systems*, I analyzed archival **Chandra X-ray Observatory**
spectroscopic and imaging data of giant elliptical galaxies exhibiting multiple
generations of X-ray cavities.

The project involved:

- Identifying and characterizing X-ray cavities inflated by AGN jets  
- Developing an improved methodology for determining cavity ages and energetics  
- Investigating the impact of inclination effects using a custom toy model
  applied to observed cavity properties  

This work helps us better quantify how efficiently AGN can heat and displace
hot gas, and how that feedback may regulate further star formation.

### Figures from the thesis

I plan to add a few key figures here (e.g. cavity maps, profiles, or toy-model
illustrations). Once the images are exported from the thesis, they can be added
under `assets/img/research/` and included like this:

```

## Shocks in the cosmic web

For my master’s thesis, *Exploring Shock Structures in the Cosmic Web* (tentative
title), I am interested in how large-scale shocks trace the assembly of structure
in the Universe and how they affect the thermodynamic state of the intergalactic
medium.

Current directions include:

- Identifying and characterizing shock fronts in simulations of the cosmic web  
- Connecting shock properties to underlying large-scale structure and accretion  
- Exploring how shocks redistribute energy and entropy in diffuse gas  

This project is still in progress; over time, I plan to add figures, notes, and
selected results here as the work develops.
